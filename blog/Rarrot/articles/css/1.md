1.	Purpose
The mechatronic system is being used in many large, medium, and small industries or enterprises in Cambodia and in the world to assist the human force for production, but some industries are using the classical mechatronic system that can only monitor or connect to another device offline. One of the main requirements of IoT-based mechatronics is to communicate between hardware and software such as from PLC, Raspberry Pi, and devices to a website or application by Modbus protocol and internet. Presently, mechatronic systems in IoT networks are controlled and monitored via industrial HMI (human-machine interface) panels, consoles, web, or mobile applications. Using these conventional control and monitoring methods of mechatronic systems within IoT networks, this method may be fully satisfactory for smaller rooms. Since the list of devices fits on one screen, we can monitor the status and control these devices almost immediately. However, in the case of several rooms or buildings, which is the case of digital factories, ordinary ways of interacting with mechatronic systems become cumbersome. In such cases, there is the possibility to apply advanced digital technologies such as extended (computer-generated) reality. Using these technologies, digital (computer-generated) objects can be inserted into the real world. The aim of this research is to design and implementation of a new method for the control and monitoring of mechatronic systems using IoT.
